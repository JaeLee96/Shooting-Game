# ShootingGame

Shooting Game created in C++ Qt Gui.
A player has to make sure no enemy passes by him or else he will lose health points.
When the health points drop to zero, player will lose the game.

There are three types of enemy that are attempting to pass by the player.
First one is regular enemy, that is neither fast nor strong. They take only one bullet to die.
Second one, however, is fast enemy who is a lot faster than the regular enemy.
Third one, is strong enemy who isn't fast but takes a lot of bullets to be killed.

Your ultimate goal as a player is to make sure no enemy passes by you by shooting them down with a bullet!
